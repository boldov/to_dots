# ToDots

Converts a Hash or Array into dot strings

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'to_dots'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install to_dots

## Usage

Translates hashes or arrays into dot syntax and adds helper methods to `Array` and `Hash`

```
{
  foo: [
    {
      bar: :baz
    }, {
      baz: :bar
    }
  ],
  baz: {
    bar: :foo
  }
}.to_dots

=> ['foo.bar.baz', 'foo.baz.bar', 'baz.bar.foo']
```

## Development

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
